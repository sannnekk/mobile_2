## Features

- Show answer before check (solve mode): When a work task has a right answer and the server flag `isAnswerVisibleBeforeCheck` is true, the task screen shows a "Показать ответ" toggle in solve mode that reveals the correct answer without submitting. In read and checked modes, right answers are displayed as usual.
